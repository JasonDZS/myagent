# Phase 4: Clarify RECONNECT Related Events - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed**: October 18, 2024
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time Spent**: ~1 hour

---

## Objective

Define clear, distinct purposes and usage patterns for three reconnection-related events to eliminate ambiguity and guide both client and server implementation.

---

## The Three Events

### 1. `user.reconnect` - Simple Session Recovery
- **Use Case**: Brief disconnection (<60s), session still exists
- **Payload**: `{session_id}`
- **Server Action**: Re-bind connection to existing session
- **Creates New Session**: ❌ No, reuses same session
- **State Verification**: ❌ No verification needed
- **Client State Restore**: ❌ No

### 2. `user.reconnect_with_state` - Stateful Recovery
- **Use Case**: Extended disconnection (60s-24h), buffer cleared
- **Payload**: `{signed_state, last_seq, last_event_id}`
- **Server Action**: Verify state, create NEW session, restore state
- **Creates New Session**: ✅ Yes, new ID generated
- **State Verification**: ✅ Cryptographic signature verification
- **Client State Restore**: ✅ Yes, from client snapshot

### 3. `user.request_state` - Explicit Export
- **Use Case**: Planned operation, client wants to save session
- **Payload**: `{session_id}`
- **Server Action**: Export current state, sign/encrypt it
- **Creates New Session**: ❌ No, purely export operation
- **State Verification**: ❌ No verification, just export
- **Client State Restore**: ❌ No immediate restore
- **Connection Impact**: ❌ Connection remains unchanged

---

## Deliverables

### 1. RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md (1,450+ lines)

**Location**: `docs/ws-protocol/stable/RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md`

**Content**:

#### Overview Section
- Explains the three distinct event types
- Key differences and decision tree
- When to use each event

#### Event Details (Per Event)
Each of the three events has detailed coverage:

1. **RECONNECT**
   - Purpose and use case
   - Client scenario (brief network hiccup)
   - Payload structure (minimal - just session_id)
   - Server handling code
   - Response events
   - Error handling

2. **RECONNECT_WITH_STATE**
   - Purpose and use case
   - Client scenario (extended disconnect, buffer cleared)
   - Payload structure (signed_state + last_seq)
   - State format specification
   - Server handling code (7-step workflow)
   - Comparison table (vs RECONNECT)
   - Error handling

3. **REQUEST_STATE**
   - Purpose and use case (planned export, not reconnection)
   - Client scenario (user saving work before closing)
   - Payload structure (just session_id)
   - Server handling code
   - Key points (export-only semantics)
   - Error handling
   - Typical usage pattern (save → close → restart → restore)

#### Visual Aids
- **Decision Tree**: Which event to send based on circumstances
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Three scenarios
  1. Brief network hiccup (RECONNECT)
  2. Extended offline with state restore (RECONNECT_WITH_STATE)
  3. Planned session export (REQUEST_STATE)

#### Error Handling
- Session expired recovery
- Invalid state signature handling
- Inactive session errors
- Recovery strategies for each error

#### Implementation Checklist
- Backend checklist (server.py responsibilities)
- Frontend checklist (client responsibilities)
- Testing requirements

#### Summary Table
- Quick reference: Event name, trigger, session ID requirement, payload, use case, response

### 2. Enhanced events.py

**File**: `myagent/ws/events.py`

**Changes**: UserEvents class docstring expanded (+25 lines)

**Before**:
```python
class UserEvents:
    """User (client) event types - sent from client to server.
    Usage patterns:
    - MESSAGE: content = user query text, metadata = source/client info
    - RESPONSE: content = {approved, feedback}, metadata = response context
    - ACK: metadata = {last_seq, received_count} for reliable delivery
    - RECONNECT*: content/metadata = session recovery info
    """
```

**After**:
```python
class UserEvents:
    """User (client) event types - sent from client to server.
    Usage patterns:
    - MESSAGE: content = user query text, metadata = source/client info
    - RESPONSE: content = {approved, feedback}, metadata = response context
    - ACK: metadata = {last_seq, received_count} for reliable delivery

    Reconnection Events (Three Distinct Types):
    - RECONNECT: Simple session resume (short disconnect, <60s)
      · Payload: {session_id}
      · Use: Connection briefly lost, session still valid

    - RECONNECT_WITH_STATE: Stateful recovery with client snapshot (<60s-24h)
      · Payload: {signed_state, last_seq, last_event_id}
      · Use: Extended disconnect, client has exported state
      · Creates NEW session (verifies client state integrity)

    - REQUEST_STATE: Explicit state export request (planned operation)
      · Payload: {session_id} only
      · Use: Client wants to save session before closing
      · Does NOT trigger reconnection, purely export
      · Response includes signed_state for later RECONNECT_WITH_STATE
    """
```

**Impact**:
- Clear differentiation of all three events
- Payload requirements explicit
- Time windows defined (<60s vs 60s-24h vs planned)
- Semantic differences highlighted
- No code breaking changes

### 3. Enhanced server.py Comments

**File**: `myagent/ws/server.py`

**Changes**:
- Event dispatch comments (+6 lines)
- `_handle_reconnect_with_state()` docstring expanded (+21 lines)
- `_handle_request_state()` docstring expanded (+32 lines)
- References to RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md

**Event Dispatch Comments** (lines 199-214):
```python
elif event_type == UserEvents.RECONNECT_WITH_STATE:
    # RECONNECT_WITH_STATE: Stateful recovery with client-provided state export
    # Use Case: Extended disconnect (60s-24h) where event buffer may be cleared
    # Workflow: Verify state signature → Create new session → Restore state → Replay events
    # See: docs/ws-protocol/stable/RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md for detailed flow
    logger.info("Handling RECONNECT_WITH_STATE event")
    await self._handle_reconnect_with_state(websocket, connection_id, message)

elif event_type == UserEvents.REQUEST_STATE and session_id:
    # REQUEST_STATE: Explicit state export request (not reconnection)
    # Use Case: Client intentionally wants to save session state
    # Workflow: Verify session → Create snapshot → Sign/encrypt → Send signed_state
    # Client can later use signed_state with RECONNECT_WITH_STATE after disconnect
    # See: docs/ws-protocol/stable/RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md for detailed flow
    logger.info(f"Handling REQUEST_STATE event for session {session_id}")
    await self._handle_request_state(websocket, connection_id, session_id, message)
```

**Handler Docstrings**:
- Each now has comprehensive documentation
- Step-by-step workflow detailed
- Key differences highlighted
- References to RECONNECT_CLARIFICATION.md

## Key Clarifications

### Semantic Differences

| Aspect | RECONNECT | RECONNECT_WITH_STATE | REQUEST_STATE |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Initiator** | Automatic (connection lost) | Automatic (reconnect attempt) | User action (deliberate) |
| **Session ID** | ✅ Required (existing) | ❌ Not required (creates new) | ✅ Required (active) |
| **State Export** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (client provides) | ❌ No (server exports) |
| **Verification** | ❌ None | ✅ Signature verification | ❌ None |
| **Time Window** | <60s | 60s-24h | Any time |
| **Reconnection** | ✅ Yes (resume) | ✅ Yes (restore) | ❌ No (export only) |
| **Buffer Requirement** | ✅ Events must be buffered | ❌ Not needed (have snapshot) | N/A |
| **New Session ID** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Connection Impact** | Re-established | Re-established | Unchanged |

### Decision Tree

```
My connection is lost. Do I have local state saved?
├─ NO, and it was just dropped
│  └─> Send user.reconnect
│      (Just re-establish connection)
│
├─ NO, but I had STATE_EXPORTED earlier
│  └─> Send user.reconnect_with_state
│      (Restore from snapshot + get missed events)
│
└─ YES, I'm intentionally closing/suspending
   └─> Send user.request_state FIRST
       (Export current state for later)
       Then later:
       └─> Send user.reconnect_with_state
           (Resume from exported snapshot)
```

### Error Recovery Paths

**RECONNECT Error**: Session not found
→ Client should send `user.create_session` (start fresh)

**RECONNECT_WITH_STATE Error**: Invalid signature
→ Client should send `user.request_state` again (get fresh export)

**REQUEST_STATE Error**: Session inactive
→ Client should send `user.create_session` (start fresh)
